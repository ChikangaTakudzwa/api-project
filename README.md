# Overview

## API built using Django Rest Framework

` "https://chikanga.pythonanywhere.com/api/books/" `

The API endpoint allows users to create, retrieve and delete a list of coding books and their details from a database using an HTTP method request. The books are stored in a serverless database on Bit.io, which is connected to the API using the psycopg2 library. The endpoint is developed using Django Rest Framework and is hosted on PythonAnywhere. Users can access the endpoint by making a GET request to the API's URL. The response is a JSON object that includes information about each book, including its Title, Author, Price and Date.
